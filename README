A utility to manage the current github user or pair of users on a shared
workstation setup such as those commonly found at software consulting firms and
developer bootcamps.

Installation

  $ git clone https://github.com/hacktiv8/set-git-user.git
  $ cd set-git-user
  $ ./install # will install to /usr/local/bin

The `set-git-user` executable is also aliased (via symlinks) to `iam` and
`weare` for a nicer user interface.

The simplest use of this utility is to set the current git author (globally)
based on a github username:

  $ iam quackingduck
  $ git config --global user.name
  Myles Byrne
  $ git config --global user.email
  myles@myles.id.au
  $ get-git-user
  quackingduck

But you can also use it to set the current git author to a pair or group of users. The
author email will be pair+{username}.{username}@{domain} where the usernames
are ordered alphanumerically (and therefore deterministically) and the domain is
set by the ORG_DOMAIN environment variable (which you probably want to set
in workstation's shell config).

  $ ORG_DOMAIN=hacktiv8.com weare quackingduck mweitzel alycit
  Alyssa Diaz & Matthew Weitzel & Myles Byrne
  $ git config --global user.email
  pair+alycit.mweitzel.articfox@hacktiv8.com
  $ get-git-user
  alycit
  mweitzel
  articfox

If your organization uses Google apps for email then set up the address
pair@your.org to bounce incoming emails - Google automatically routes
{user}+{anything}@your.org to {user}@your.org
